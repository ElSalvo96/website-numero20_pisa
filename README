For compile file menu.ts, install typescript

    npm install -g typescript

    Re/open an active terminal and then check with: tsc -v

Use command for compile:

    tsc js/menu.ts

In case of problems:

    Updating the Path environment variable:

    Search Environment Variables in the start menu
    Select Edit the system environment variables
    Select the Environment Variables... button in the Advanced section
    Look in the System Variables section for the Path variable
    Double click that variable
    Select New...
    Enter the location your npm config downloads global packages at. You can find out where by using the npm list -g command. For me, it was at
        C:\Users\MyUsername\AppData\Roaming\npm â€” be sure to replace MyUsername with your username
    Re/open an active terminal

    Use the tsc -v command to observe the result
